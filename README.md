# Front End Development Libraries

üß† Overview

The Front End Development Libraries section of freeCodeCamp introduces popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks that help you build powerful, interactive, and modern web applications more efficiently.

In this section, you‚Äôll learn to use Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React, and Redux, as well as how to combine them effectively to create dynamic UIs and manage application state.

üìö Topics Covered

**1. Bootstrap**

Learn to use the Bootstrap CSS framework to design responsive, mobile-first web pages quickly.

Understand the **grid system**, **components**, and **utility classes**.

Style buttons, navigation bars, forms, and modals without writing extensive custom CSS.

**Example:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
```

**2. jQuery**

Simplify DOM manipulation and event handling using jQuery‚Äôs concise syntax.

Learn how to select elements, change styles, and respond to user interactions.

**Example:**
```javascript
$("button").click(function() {
$("p").hide();
});

```

**3. Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**

Use **variables**, **nesting**, and **mixins** to write cleaner, reusable CSS.

Compile Sass into CSS for production.

**Example**:
```scss
$primary-color: #3498db;

button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  &:hover {
    background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%);
  }
}
```

**4. React**

Learn the fundamentals of **React**, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Understand **components**, **props**, and **state**.

Practice building dynamic UI elements and managing component hierarchies.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

**5. Redux**

Master state management for large-scale applications.

Learn about **actions**, **reducers**, and the **store**.

Combine React and Redux to manage and update UI efficiently.

**Example:**
```javascript
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return { type: ADD, message };
};

```

üß© **Integration: React + Redux**

You‚Äôll also learn how to:

Connect React components to Redux state using **React-Redux**.

Dispatch actions and subscribe to store updates.

**Example:**
```jsx
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  messages: state
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);

```

üß∞ **Skills Gained**

By completing this certification, you will:

- Build **responsive web interfaces** using Bootstrap and Sass.
- Manipulate the DOM efficiently using jQuery.
- Develop **React components** and manage their **state**.
- Implement **Redux** for global state management.
- Combine React and Redux to create dynamic, scalable applications.

üèÜ **Certification Projects**

To earn the **Front End Development Libraries** Certification, you‚Äôll build **5 projects** such as:

1. Random Quote Machine
2. Markdown Previewer
3. Drum Machine
4. JavaScript Calculator
5. 25 + 5 Clock

Each project demonstrates your mastery of React and Redux.

üí° **Conclusion**

The **Front End Development Libraries** section prepares you for modern front-end development. By mastering these libraries, you‚Äôll be equipped to build sleek, responsive, and efficient user interfaces that are production-ready.
